        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Justine Frigo, and after several years in the world of libraries and administration, I recently decided to switch to web development. Currently focusing on front-end development, I specialize in VueJs and TailwindCSS, but I aim to become full-stack in the future.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I completed an intensive training program at BeCode, a Belgian non-profit organization dedicated to training for digital professions. BeCode stands out for its active, project-based pedagogy, offering practical and collaborative immersion in web development and other digital disciplines.</p>
        <h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
        <p>I am currently seeking a 3-month internship starting around October 14th. During my time at BeCode and beyond, I am motivated to acquire all the necessary skills (technical or soft skills) to excel in this new field. However, I also strive to leverage my previous experience in my future new profession.</p>
